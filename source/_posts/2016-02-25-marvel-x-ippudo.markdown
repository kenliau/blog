Two of my favorite things are Marvel and Ramen. I am a huge Marvel fan, my personal favorite superhero is Iron Man. Iron Man is a Genius, Billionaire, Philanthropist, Engineer and many others.

When I learned that Marvel is collaborating with Ippudo, I can't let this unique chance slip away. 

This collaboration is only for 2 days - 02/25/16 and 02/26/16.

## Lining Up
Because of the popularity, I decided to arrive 1.5 hours ahead to secure a spot for myself. When I arrived, there were people lining up already. I went to the end of the line and figured out I am #25 - one of the limited 40 seatings.

Since the pop up is being held on the 2nd floor of Ippudo Westside, only 10 seats are available starting at 5pm. So I got assigned the 8pm slot.
At 8pm, I arrived at Ippudo Westside once again waiting for my mission with the Avengers. First, I was taken to the secret passage to the 2nd floor of Ippudo Westside. There were posters around the stairs and I was greeted with the waitresses.

My ramen station looked like this.
