I finally got to go back to Malaysia after 6 years. Things seemed so different
from last time but yet feel familiar. The first thing I felt when exiting the
airport is the heat. Malaysia is located right on the equator. Therefore the 
only season the whole year is summer. It is always around 80F or 28C. The
weather is also unpredictable. It can rain all of the sudden, without any
warning.

In this trip, I got to meet a lot of relatives that I didn't see for a long
time. There are a lot of new cousins who I didn't even get to see because 
they weren't born 6 years ago. I was also really excited to see my friends from 
elementary school. We met multiple times for movies, food, or just to talk. 


There are so much delicious food in Malaysia. I tried to have as much unique
food there as possible. There are chicken rice, radish cake, veggie bun, 
milo ice, bread chicken with curry, flour soup, nasi lemak, etc...

I had two sub-trips when I was there. One was to hot spring and waterfall at
Kampar with my friends. The other one was a road trip to Singapore. On the way 
to Singapore, we stopped at Melaka and Johor Bahru. In Singapore, we went to 
Science Center and Universal Studio. The transformers ride at Universal Studio 
was really impressive.
