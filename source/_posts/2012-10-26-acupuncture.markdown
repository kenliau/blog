Back in the days, the Asians believe that the human body contains an important life energy called the Qi. Qi is the thread connecting all being and it takes countless forms. Qi is carried throughout the body with help of Meridians. There are fourteen main meridians in the human body and they are composed of acupuncture points that form a specific pathway. Therefore, when there are sickness occurs, the Asians believe that it is because some pathway of meridians is blocked and Qi is unable to circulate properly. To regulate the flow, they believe acupuncture is needed. 

What is *acupuncture*?

Acupuncture is an ancient art of healing that dates back to at least 2,500 years. It has been widely practiced in China and many other Asian countries. Acupuncture emphasizes on the natural healing of the body. It involves stimulating acupuncture points by the insertion of very fine, stainless steel needles. By doing that, it will regulate the flow of Qi and blood, get rid of blockage and relieve the pain and illnesses. 

Two years ago, I sprained my lower back by lifting heavy things. It made my daily routine difficult. Getting out and in of bed was miserable. So my dad took me to get acupuncture at NY. The doctor started by putting needles on my back and I just lied down on my stomach for 30 minutes. Then he removed the needles and massaged my back. Magically, my lower back got much better the next day. 

Two days ago, for no reason, my back hurts again. Actually, maybe it is not because of no reason. It might be because of the way I work on my assignments. Sitting in a position for a long time without moving can be bad. I must learn to stop doing that and move once in a while. Because of this, I went to get acupuncture for the second time in my life. Not suprisingly, it worked again and my back is getting better. 

Although there aren't really any scientific explanation for acupuncture and there are a few theories that question the effect of acupuncture, I personally believe in it. Why?? I guess it is because it works for me and we Asians are best at what we do. :)
