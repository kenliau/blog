On March 14th 2013, my friends and I departed for London for our spring break.
I never really got the time and chance to blog this trip because of school work
and exams until now. We were there at London for 10 days. In this post, I will 
suggest the things to do when you get a chance to visit London in the near 
future.

## Food

#### English Breakfast
When travelling, one of the most important things is the food there. You want 
to get a taste of how the local people eat their food and what do they eat. 
When you visit England, most people will want to try the so called 
*English Breakfast*. We did too actually. After searching for the most popular 
English Breakfast restaurant in Soho, London, we found a place called the 
**Breakfast Club**. Just like the reviews said, the line never ends. We stayed 
{% img fancybox right /images/london/fish-and-chips.jpg 192 256 'Fish and Chips' 'Fish and Chips'%}
outside and waited for more than an hour, but I think it was worth it. Here is 
a picture of the breakfast I ordered. Don't drool on your keyboard though.

#### Fish and Chips
In addition to English Breakfast, the other famous dish you must try is Fish and
Chips. Even though we couldn't find the most famous fish and chips restaurant, 
the one we been to was cheap and delicious too. At **Famous 3 Kings**, a sport
bar, we got 2 orders of fish and chips for just £11. I really miss this now...

#### Nasi Goreng
One of the nights, we went to a Malaysian restaurant located in **China Town**. 
The restaurant was called **Rasa Sayang**. I think it means "Feel the Love" in 
Malaysian. They have this Milo chocolate drink that I haven't had in a while. It
also contain the tapioca bubble. I ordered Nasi Goreng which is "Fried Rice" and
it was quite delicious. I would recommend this place for people that want to try
Malaysian food. 


## Places

#### Sherlock Holmes' Residential
If you are a super Sherlock Holmes' fan, then this is place is a Must for you to
visit. Located at **221B Baker Street**, you can walk up and down the street and
enjoy the sunny day as well as buy souvenirs for other Sherlock Holmes' fans.

#### Stamford Bridge
One of the most popular sports in England is football. It is also one of my
favorite sports. A Chelsea fan can never miss the stadium we
went to see. Located at **London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham**, it is
also the home ground of Chelsea Football Club. We went there when Chelsea was
playing in the stadium, but we didn't get to go in to watch. All I remember 
was that after the game, you can see everyone where blues storming out of the
stadium.

#### London Eye
{% img fancybox left /images/london/london-eye.jpg 256 192 'London Eye during St. Patrick Day' 'London Eye'%}
After seeing Singapore Flyer last summer, London Eye wasn't as impressive. 
It is said that Singapore Fyler is 165 meters tall while London Eye is only 120 
meters tall. I didn't get to ride Singapore Flyer last summer but I did get to 
ride the London Eye this time. When we were there, it was Saint Patrick's Day, 
so the Eye was green. I also heard that during Valentine's Day, the Eye is red.
But during regular nights, it is normally blue.

#### Big Ben
Big Ben is the nickname for the great bell of the clock by the 
**Palace of Westminster** in London. The tower is now officially called the 
Elizabeth Tower, after being renamed to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen 
Elizabeth II. Because it has become one of the most prominent symbols of 
London, travelers now come to witness it's greatness.

#### Tower Bridge
{% img fancybox left /images/london/tower-bridge.jpg 256 192 'Tower Bridge' 'Tower Bridge'%}
Tower Bridge was built from 1886 to 1894, over the River Thames. It is close to 
the Tower of London, hence the name, Tower Bridge. There is a old castle next to
it as well. We visited the old castle and I took the picture of Tower Bridge 
from it.


#### Harrods
Harrods is a huge luxury department store with more than 5 floors located in 
**Brompton Road in Knightsbridge**. I think everyone that
visits London should visit here because this is one of the kinds. But, please
don't break anything here because this is the place only 
the riches can go -.- It is because everything in the mall is expensive as HECK.
I saw a super HDTV that goes up to £20,000 and a watch that goes up to $130,000.


#### Science Museum
Located in **Exhibition Road, South Kensington**, is a huge museum with 5 
different floors. If you plan to come here, please allocate a couple days for 
just the museums. There are also other museums around it. It took us 2 hours 
{% img fancybox right /images/london/dragon.jpg 256 192 'Beautiful Dragon' 'Beautiful Dragon'%}
to walk only 2 floor of this Science Museum.

#### Warner Bros. Studio Tour - The Making of Harry Potter
{% img fancybox left /images/london/harry-potter-castle.jpg 256 192 'HP Castle' 'HP Castle'%}
Speaking of Harry Potter, I also took a train to 
**Watford Junction railway station** to visit the Harry Potter tour.
In there, there are costumes worn by the characters, the dining hall, the movie
effects, Diagon Alley, magical creatures, castles, pictures, etc... Here is a
huge castle model and a beautiful dragon.

#### King's Cross St. Pancras Station
This is a huge train statio like the Penn Station in New York. I came here to 
take a train to Cambridge to visit an old friend from elementary school. In
addition, the 9 3/4 train platform to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
is also located here. It is also the train station where they filmed the first 
Harry Potter movie series.

#### Madame Tussauds™
This Madame Tussauds in London was quite different from the one in New York. 
Even though they have the similar entrance with celebrities standing in a ball 
scene, the rest isn't the same. I met Robert Downey Jr. "in person"... 
and Iron Man :) After the wax people, there was also a 
Scream House where there are real people 
jumping out of nowhere to scare the HECK out of you in a dark scary place. 
Quite an adventure... Lastly, there was also a Marvel 4D movie that featured
Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Spider-Man, Wolverine, etc...



## Interesting Facts
#### Oyster Card
The thing that I am most impressed in London is it's transportation service. 
With a card called the Oyster Card, we can get underground tube fares,
overground train fares, bus fares and put it on the Oyster Card. It is extremely
convenient. We got a limited edition one too!

#### Military Time
Everywhere in London, they tend to use military time. Very interesting. 

#### Paid Toilets
Unlike the US restroom, where they are free to use, in London, some public 
toilets requires you to put a few pence to use it. I am not surprised because 
most public toilets in Malaysia ask you to pay too. 

#### Basements
This is the most bizarre thing. Most restaurants in London has a basement
which normally is twice as big as the first floor of the restaurant. WEIRD...
