There is a Chinese saying - 病从口入 (pinyin: bìng cóng kǒu rù) which literally 
means sickness enters from the mouth. Yes. In my opinion, the causes to various 
sicknesses may be because of the eating habits of the people. One common example
I can think of is **stroke**. Fast foods that are high in fat and cholesterol 
can build up plaque in arteries over time, causing blockage. When blood can't 
be carry to the brain, it will result to a stroke. In order to  live life to the
fullest, I believe it is best to have a healthy body and mind by starting with 
a healthy eating habit and boycott **FAST FOOD!**

Breakfast is the most important meals of the day. That's what they always say.
But I do agree to that. Many of the young people these days do not eat breakfast
because many of them sleep in, and thus skipping the morning hours that was
supposed to be breakfast hours. Even when some wake up early in the morning,
they still tend to skip breakfast because they are rushing to go to school or
work. There are three benefits of eating breakfast in the morning. 

>
+ Warms up the Metabolism!
  > 
    When you put food in your body in the morning, it sends a message to the
    brain telling it start working on it. This wakes up the metabolism so that
    it is ready to work throughout the day.
  >
+ Starts the day with a pretty good Mood!
  >
    With a nutritious meal, we won't get hungry in the morning. NOT hungry =
    happy. It also provides us with plenty of energy to go through the day,
    indirectly keep us bright and optimistic.
  >
+ Recharge!
  >
    Just like our phone, we need to charge it in order for it to work. Breakfast
    replenish the energy we used up since last night dinner. By recharging the
    brain and body, we'll be more efficient in doing anything. We'll pay better
    attention at school or work better at our daily routine.

Breakfast can be as easy as eating a fruit or milk over cereal. Over the past
months, I have adopted the habit of eating whole wheat sandwiches and an apple
every morning when commuting to school. 

In addition to having breakfast in the morning to have a healthier life style, 
exercise is another important factor. There are a lot of benefits of exercising.
Here is two for example:

>
+ Improves mood.
  > 
    Physical activity stimulates chemicals in our body that may make us feel 
    happier and more relaxed. You may also feel better about your appearance
    when exercise regularly, thus boosting our confidence and self-esteem.
  >
+ More energy!
  >
    Regular physical activity can also improve our muscle strength and boost
    endurance. When exercising, our body deliver oxygen and nutrients to our
    body tissues, helping the cardiovascular system work more efficiently.
    With a more efficient heart and lungs, we will have more energy to face
    all kinds of chores.
